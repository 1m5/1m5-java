# ManCon Node
This module is for instantiating the platform in a headless configuration testing local communication possibilities.
It is expected to be deployed within a 1M5 RM (Micro-Relay) to simulate end-users in a specific location reporting
all statistics to known 1M5 peers via multi-cast periodically.
