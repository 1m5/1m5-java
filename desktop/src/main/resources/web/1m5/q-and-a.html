            <h4><a href="#users">Users</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="#gifters">Gifters</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="#developers">Developers</a></h4>
          </header>
          <h4 id="users">Users</h4>
          <div class="row gap-y align-items-center py-7" id="centrow">
            <div class="text-left col-md-8 mx-auto">
              <h5 class="mt-4" style="color: #8072ba">Is this application decentralized?</h5>
              <p>Yes, it is fully decentralized in that it relies on no servers - all communications are peer-to-peer, is not backed by any organization, is not registered under any state, and is fully in the public domain of all sentient beings. It is developed by a small group of developers and will never be a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) as voting is considered in violation of the NAP and large organizations largely require voting or hierarchies, yet the codebase is fully open and therefore can be easily forked and thus still decentralized.</p>
              <h5 class="mt-4" style="color: #8072ba">How does it maintain my privacy?</h5>
              <p>It uses TOR and I2P when communicating over the internet to ensure the destination IP addresses for requests are not associated with your IP address and encrypts all data with keys you generate and control maintained on your drives, never sent out. All code is fully open-sourced so that you or someone you trust can verify no back-doors were added. You have full control over the sensors and can shut them down at any time if you believe they shouldn't be in use. If you're in a known jurisdiction not recognizing freedom of speech, I2P will not publish your IP address to its shared database (netDb - shared among many peers) thus keeping your use of I2P private - can be overridden manually either way.</p>
              <h5 class="mt-4" style="color: #8072ba">How does it help me resist being censored?</h5>
              <p>When using the app, if during its use of TOR it gets blocked, it will use I2P to route around the block. Same for I2P, it will use TOR. If both are blocked, it will try to use Bluetooth to route around the blocks. With no userbase, Bluetooth is not yet a viable alternative unless the people within range of your bluetooth are using 1M5 and allow you to connect. Work is progressing on supporting LiFi (Light Fidelity) and the full radio spectrum to communciate over light and long distances with radio to get around internet censorship.</p>
              <h5 class="mt-4" style="color: #8072ba">How can I use this app?</h5>
              <p>Currently there are no installers so you must download the project from GitHub, build with Maven, and follow the directions on how to start it. It currently is an alpha version in constant flux so in no way ready for real-world usage. It's best started up in an IDE like IntelliJ and ran as a demo for input into development. It is expected to be ready for real-world testing by version 0.7.0 which is expected to be released mid-2020.</p>
              <h5 class="mt-4" style="color: #8072ba">Who are the primary users targeted?</h5>
              <p>All whom take their privacy seriously - this should be everyone. Those who are well aware of their need for privacy and whom will be supported as much as possible are:<br/>Investigative Journalists, Activists, Refugees, Whistleblowers, and the oppressed.</p>
              <h5 class="mt-4" style="color: #8072ba">Will people be able to use this for unethical purposes?</h5>
              <p>This is a tool like any tool and can be used ethically or unethically like any tool. This mission tries to not support anyone violating the NAP (Non-Aggression Principle). If it's discovered someone is using it to violate the NAP, we will do everything in our power to prevent it but will not violate the NAP to do so.</p>
              <h5 class="mt-4" style="color: #8072ba">Why only desktop? Where is the mobile support?</h5>
              <p>The mission requires open-source and most phones are running on closed-source operating systems, Mac and Windows being the worst. Google started out with Android as an open source OS to win the market over but is slowing becoming closed and proprietary. So Linux desktop is the primary foundation. Future support for running on mobiles will be developed for phones that can run an unrestricted JVM such as Purism and open source phone hardware.</p>
              <h5 class="mt-4" style="color: #8072ba">How much overhead comes with using many networks simultaneously?</h5>
              <p>This can depend on how many of the sensors are available and activated. Early versions are just using TOR, I2P, and Bluetooth. In these versions, TOR is primarily used for browsing and I2P for messaging. When TOR is blocked, I2P is used for relaying and vice-versa. When both are blocked, Bluetooth is attempted for relay. This requires very little overhead. Later versions with LiFi will see similar little overhead comparable to Bluetooth. It's not until we reach using a Full-Spectrum radio where overhead can go up, especially on battery usage for transmitting over longer distances. In these uses, additional power will likely be needed and will be addressed through recommended practices and additional hardware. If all sensors are running while integrating with Bitcoin, Monero, and Lightning local nodes, then we can expect a fair amount of overhead although this setup would be more likely on a desktop or powerful Raspberry Pi or Pi Farm. Hardware recommendations for each configuration will be provided.</p>
              <h5 class="mt-4" style="color: #8072ba">Why native desktop? Where's the HTML5 client?</h5>
              <p>Browsers are notoriously difficult to make secure and efficient. A browser is embedded within the native desktop to improve control over security while ensuring it can be used with all of the sensors working together to ensure you can browse anything globally (static websites - not advanced webapps).</p>
              <h5 class="mt-4" style="color: #8072ba">Is this tool legal?</h5>
              <p>Laws today are created by one group of people to control the behaviour of another group and thus a violation of the NAP. This mission supports ethical behavior over any law. If this tool is illegal in your jurisdiction, you must make the decision if free speech is worth violating that law. It currently is not known to be illegal in any jurisdiction although some jurisdictions work to block TOR.</p>
              <h5 class="mt-4" style="color: #8072ba">Are transactions taxable events?</h5>
              <p>Taxation today is a form of robbery and thereby violates the NAP, therefore the platform is unable to forcefully take from one group to give to another. If you feel this puts you in danger with your jurisdiction's taxation laws, you must make a decision on whether free speech is worth violating those laws.</p>

            <div class="text-left col-md-8 mx-auto">
              <h5 class="mt-4" style="color: #8072ba">How will the gift money be used?</h5>
              <p>Primarily to fund development and support of the platform but also includes web site hosting fees and other fees associated with supporting the mission. The mission's <a href="public-roadmap.html">roadmap</a> lays out the work to be accomplished.</p>
              <h5 class="mt-4" style="color: #8072ba">What form of money do you accept?</h5>
              <p>Bitcoin (BTC) and Monero (XMR). If interested, send a request to <a href="mailto:info@1m5.io">info@1m5.io</a> with GIFT in subject line and whether you wish to give BTC or XMR and an address will be generated and returned. Use the fingerprint below to verify the public key is valid if possible. It's recommended to use <a href="https://bisq.network" target="_blank">Bisq.network</a> or any wallet that uses TOR. In the future, it is planned to support gifting directly in the 1M5 dapp.</p>
              <h5 class="mt-4" style="color: #8072ba">Can a gift be written off my taxes?</h5>
              <p>1M5 is not registered in any jurisdiction so it's not likely a tax write off. Talk to a local tax attorney if unsure.</p>

            <div class="text-left col-md-8 mx-auto">
              <h5 class="mt-4" style="color: #8072ba">How can I contribute?</h5>
              <p>Currently the repository on 1M5 is under heavy development so forking and fixing something is not recommended as it's changing so rapidly. The best method to support it today is to contact the development group at info@1m5.io, discuss your background including any links to your past work if identity is not an issue, what you would like to work on, and what it would cost in BTC or XMR.</p>
              <h5 class="mt-4" style="color: #8072ba">Why Java?</h5>
              <p>Java is the 'Swiss-Army Knife' of programming languages, has two decades to flush out a strong virtual machine, massive amount of code to choose from, one of the largest talent pools, platform independent, leads in the number of progressive projects in development (with C/C++ being close in decentralized apps), and I2P (the foundational network) implemented in Java.</p>
              <h5 class="mt-4" style="color: #8072ba">Why a custom SOA/EDA foundation?</h5>
              <p>Enterprise Service Buses (ESB) with affiliated Message-Oriented Middleware (MOM) are quite heavy in implementation and it's desired to keep the codebase as small as possible as it is desired to support DoT (Decentralization of Things) devices. Spring's module + integration support does not fully satisfy the requirements and brings much more than desired.</p>
              <h5 class="mt-4" style="color: #8072ba">Where are the Spring and Google libraries?</h5>
              <p>To keep the codebase small, Spring, Google, and Apache libraries are avoided.</p>
              <h5 class="mt-4" style="color: #8072ba">Why is routing so confusing?</h5>
              <p>Services are completely decoupled so that they can be orchestrated dynamically during real-time operations. This is accomplished using a dynamic routing stack contained in the envelope that is passed around. This is more complex than just calling a method of an object yet allows great flexibility in execution while virtually eliminating interface breakage down to data payload breaks - each service is responsible for handling what data comes in and versioning. When making a request for a service, the operation name, the payload expected by the service, and the results expected from the service need to be known prior to making the call. This will come with a future API to simplify many common calls.</p>
              <h5 class="mt-4" style="color: #8072ba">Codebase doesn't use advanced techniques. Is this old code?</h5>
              <p>The code is intentionally implemented to be as simple as possible (targeted to 1.4). Many new language features add complexity while reducing transparency for little to no gain:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Generics (1.5) and lambdas (1.8) are avoided unless a big impact on design</li>
                <li>Verbosity is chosen over code size for visibility</li>
                <li>Excessive verbosity in variable names is also avoided keeping variable names especially small when within very small scopes</li>
                <li>Classes are designed based on cohesion/coupling not size; some classes intentionally reach upwards of 1000 lines; the minimal number of objects with strong cohesion while supporting the right amount of coupling is a great desire to keep it simple</li>
              </ul>
